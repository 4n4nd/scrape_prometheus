# Scrape Prometheus
This python application has been written to scrape data from Prometheus and store it to a long term block storage like CEPH or S3 as JSON objects. So the data can be used and processed at a later time more easily. It also contains templates to be run as a CronJob or as a single one time pod on OpenShift.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

To run this application you will need to install several libraries listed in the requirements.txt.

To install all the dependencies at once, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
